# Specialist Agent Template
#
# Use this template to create domain-specific agents.
# Copy this file, rename it, and customize.
#
# NOTE: In most cases, the generic `developer` agent is sufficient.
# Domain knowledge should come from design docs and contracts.
# Only create specialists when you need deeply specific expertise.
#
# To use:
#   1. Copy this file: cp specialist-template.yaml my-domain-agent.yaml
#   2. Change agent_type to match your domain (e.g., "ml", "infra", "frontend")
#   3. Customize the system prompt
#   4. Use in tasks with: agent_type: my-domain

name: "[Domain] Specialist Agent"
agent_type: specialist  # Change this to your domain (e.g., "ml", "infra", "frontend")
