# Example Specialist Agents
#
# This directory contains example specialist agent configurations.
# These are OPTIONAL - the generic `developer` agent handles most use cases.
#
# Only create specialists when you need deeply specific domain expertise
# that can't be provided through design docs and contracts alone.
#
# Files here are NOT auto-loaded. To use one:
#   1. Copy to parent directory: cp examples/iam-specialist.yaml ../iam-agent.yaml
#   2. Reference in tasks: agent_type: iam
